  - Comment sanitization and security checks
  - User-friendly error messages

### 4. Error Handling

#### Comprehensive Error Types
- **Location Errors**: Permission denied, services disabled, GPS unavailable
- **Network Errors**: Connectivity issues, timeout handling
- **Validation Errors**: Invalid form data, constraint violations
- **Rate Limiting**: Time-based restrictions with countdown
- **Photo Upload Errors**: File size, format, upload failures
- **Database Errors**: Connection issues, constraint violations

#### Error Recovery
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retry for transient failures
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback options when possible

## Complete User Journey

### 1. Initiation
1. User taps "Post Vibe Check" button on venue detail page
2. System checks user authentication
3. Modal opens with VibeCheckPostingFlow component

### 2. Location Verification
1. System requests location permissions if needed
2. GPS coordinates are retrieved with retry mechanism
3. Distance to venue is calculated
4. Location verification status is displayed to user
5. Form is enabled only if user is within 100 meters

### 3. Form Interaction
1. User selects busyness rating (1-5 scale)
2. User optionally enters comment (max 280 characters)
3. User optionally selects photo from gallery or camera
4. Real-time validation provides immediate feedback
5. Submit button is enabled only when form is valid

### 4. Rate Limiting Check
1. System checks if user has posted to this venue in the last hour
2. If rate limited, countdown timer is displayed
3. User must wait until countdown expires

### 5. Submission Process
1. Final validation of all form data
2. Photo upload (if provided) with progress tracking
3. Vibe check creation in database
4. Real-time broadcast to subscribers
5. Cache invalidation for affected data

### 6. Success Feedback
1. Success alert with vibe check details
2. Option to view live feed or stay on venue page
3. Modal closes and returns to venue details
4. Real-time update of venue vibe checks

### 7. Error Handling
1. Specific error messages for different failure types
2. Retry options for recoverable errors
3. Clear guidance for user action required
4. Graceful fallback to previous state
