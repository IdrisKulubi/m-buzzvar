# Supabase to Neon DB + Better Auth Migration Requirements

## Introduction

This migration project involves transitioning the Buzzvar platform from Supabase to Neon DB for database operations and Better Auth for authentication across both the mobile Expo app and Next.js web admin portal. The migration must maintain all existing functionality while improving performance, reducing costs, and providing better developer experience with modern authentication flows that support both Expo and Next.js seamlessly.

The migration will preserve all existing data, maintain API compatibility, and ensure zero downtime during the transition. Both applications will continue to share the same database and authentication system, ensuring real-time synchronization between mobile and web platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to migrate from Supabase to Neon DB so that I can benefit from better performance, lower costs, and improved PostgreSQL features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. WHEN I test the migration THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing API functionality and data integrity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace Supabase Auth with Better Auth so that I can have more control over authentication flows and better support for both Expo and Next.js.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I implement Better Auth THEN the system SHALL support email/password authentication for both mobile and web
2. WHEN I configure OAuth THEN the system SHALL support Google OAuth for both Expo and Next.js applications
3. WHEN I set up session management THEN the system SHALL use secure session handling with proper cookie management
4. WHEN I implement role-based access THEN the system SHALL maintain existing admin and venue owner role distinctions
5. WHEN I migrate existing users THEN the system SHALL preserve all user accounts and their associated data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want the Expo app to work seamlessly with Better Auth so that I can continue using all authentication features without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the mobile app THEN the system SHALL authenticate using Better Auth with Expo integration
2. WHEN I sign in with Google THEN the system SHALL use Better Auth's social authentication with proper deep linking
3. WHEN I store session data THEN the system SHALL use Expo SecureStore for secure token storage
4. WHEN I make authenticated requests THEN the system SHALL automatically include authentication headers
5. WHEN I use offline features THEN the system SHALL maintain session persistence across app restarts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a web admin user, I want the Next.js portal to work with Better Auth so that I can access all administrative features with improved authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the web portal THEN the system SHALL authenticate using Better Auth with Next.js integration
2. WHEN I sign in with Google OAuth THEN the system SHALL handle the authentication flow seamlessly
3. WHEN I navigate protected routes THEN the system SHALL use Better Auth middleware for route protection
4. WHEN I access admin features THEN the system SHALL verify my role using Better Auth session data
5. WHEN I manage venues THEN the system SHALL maintain proper authorization checks for venue ownership

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to migrate all database operations from Supabase to Neon DB so that I can maintain data consistency and improve performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I migrate database queries THEN the system SHALL replace all Supabase client calls with direct PostgreSQL queries
2. WHEN I implement connection management THEN the system SHALL use proper connection pooling and error handling
3. WHEN I set up real-time features THEN the system SHALL implement WebSocket-based real-time updates without Supabase realtime
4. WHEN I handle file storage THEN the system SHALL migrate from Supabase Storage to a compatible solution (AWS S3 or similar)
5. WHEN I optimize queries THEN the system SHALL leverage Neon's performance features and proper indexing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain API compatibility during migration so that both applications continue to work without breaking changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I update database operations THEN the system SHALL maintain the same API response formats
2. WHEN I change authentication THEN the system SHALL preserve existing user session behavior
3. WHEN I migrate real-time features THEN the system SHALL maintain the same WebSocket event structure
4. WHEN I update file uploads THEN the system SHALL preserve the same upload API endpoints
5. WHEN I deploy changes THEN the system SHALL support gradual rollout with rollback capabilities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive testing and validation so that I can ensure the migration is successful and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run migration tests THEN the system SHALL validate all data integrity and consistency
2. WHEN I test authentication flows THEN the system SHALL verify all login scenarios work correctly
3. WHEN I test API endpoints THEN the system SHALL confirm all existing functionality is preserved
4. WHEN I perform load testing THEN the system SHALL demonstrate improved or equivalent performance
5. WHEN I validate real-time features THEN the system SHALL confirm WebSocket connections work properly

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want proper deployment and rollback procedures so that I can safely migrate production systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I prepare for deployment THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive backup and rollback procedures
2. WHEN I deploy to staging THEN the system SHALL validate all features work in a production-like environment
3. WHEN I perform the production migration THEN the system SHALL minimize downtime and provide status monitoring
4. WHEN I need to rollback THEN the system SHALL support quick reversion to Supabase if issues arise
5. WHEN I complete migration THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring and alerting for the new infrastructure

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated development workflows so that I can continue developing features efficiently with the new stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I set up local development THEN the system SHALL provide easy setup with Neon DB and Better Auth
2. WHEN I run tests THEN the system SHALL support comprehensive testing with the new authentication system
3. WHEN I develop new features THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation for the new stack
4. WHEN I debug issues THEN the system SHALL provide proper logging and error handling
5. WHEN I deploy changes THEN the system SHALL support CI/CD pipelines with the new infrastructure

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want cost optimization and improved performance so that the platform can scale efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria
